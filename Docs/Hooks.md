# Hooks

Hooks within the discord extension are only called on plugins that are registered to receive them and also will only be called on plugins the information is related to. 
By default all plugins with a connected DiscordClient will be registered to receive hooks for the bot they're connect for.
A list of all hooks can be found in the DiscordHooks.cs file.
If a plugin wishes to receive hooks for a specific client they need to get access to that client either by the plugin passing the client in a hook or a plugin can lookup a client for a specific plugin.
To lookup a client for a plugin you can do the following:

```c#
DiscordClient client = DiscordClient.GetClient(plugin);
```

or

```c#
DiscordClient client = DiscordClient.GetClient(pluginName);
```
